# Detailed Explanation of the `edges` Function

This document provides a thorough, line-by-line explanation of the `edges` function, which applies the Sobel operator to detect edges in an image. The function identifies regions with significant intensity changes, which often correspond to edges in an image.

## Function Overview
```c
void edges(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])
```
- **Purpose:** This function enhances edge details in an image using gradient computations in the horizontal (`gx`) and vertical (`gy`) directions.
- **Parameters:**
  - `height` and `width`: Dimensions of the image.
  - `image`: A 2D array representing the image, where each pixel is an `RGBTRIPLE` struct.

---

## Code Breakdown

### Step 1: Create a Copy of the Original Image
```c
RGBTRIPLE copy[height][width];
```
- A temporary 2D array `copy` is created to store the original pixel values. This ensures that calculations for a pixel are based on the original image, not modified values.

### Step 2: Define Sobel Kernels
```c
int gx[3][3] = {{-1, 0, 1}, {-2, 0, 2}, {-1, 0, 1}};
int gy[3][3] = {{-1, -2, -1}, {0, 0, 0}, {1, 2, 1}};
```
- **gx Kernel:** Detects changes in the horizontal direction (left to right).
- **gy Kernel:** Detects changes in the vertical direction (top to bottom).
- Both kernels are 3x3 matrices used for convolution.

### Step 3: Copy the Image
```c
for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < width; j++)
    {
        copy[i][j] = image[i][j];
    }
}
```
- **Purpose:** Duplicate the original image into the `copy` array.
- **Why:** To ensure computations use unaltered pixel values.

### Step 4: Iterate Over Each Pixel
```c
for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < width; j++)
    {
        // Initialize gradient variables
    }
}
```
- Outer loops iterate through each pixel `(i, j)` in the image.
- Gradients for each color channel are initialized here.

### Step 5: Initialize Gradient Variables
```c
int rgx = 0, ggx = 0, bgx = 0;
int rgy = 0, ggy = 0, bgy = 0;
```
- **rgx, ggx, bgx:** Store horizontal gradient sums for the red, green, and blue channels.
- **rgy, ggy, bgy:** Store vertical gradient sums for the red, green, and blue channels.

### Step 6: Apply Sobel Kernels to Surrounding Pixels
```c
for (int di = -1; di <= 1; di++)
{
    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; dj++)
    {
        int ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
        if (ni >= 0 && ni < height && nj >= 0 && nj < width)
        {
            // Accumulate gradients
        }
    }
}
```
- **Purpose:** Iterate through the 3x3 grid of neighbors around pixel `(i, j)`.
- **Edge Handling:** The `if` condition ensures that indices `ni` and `nj` are within image boundaries.
- **Variables:**
  - `ni`: Row index of the neighboring pixel.
  - `nj`: Column index of the neighboring pixel.

### Step 7: Compute Gradients for Each Channel
```c
rgx += copy[ni][nj].rgbtRed * gx[di + 1][dj + 1];
rgy += copy[ni][nj].rgbtRed * gy[di + 1][dj + 1];
// Similarly for green and blue channels
```
- **Purpose:** Accumulate weighted contributions from neighboring pixels based on Sobel kernels (`gx` and `gy`).
- **Operations:**
  - Multiply the pixel value by the corresponding kernel weight.
  - Add the result to the running gradient total.

### Step 8: Compute Final Gradient Magnitudes
```c
int G_red = round(sqrt((rgx * rgx) + (rgy * rgy)));
int G_green = round(sqrt((ggx * ggx) + (ggy * ggy)));
int G_blue = round(sqrt((bgx * bgx) + (bgy * bgy)));
```
- **Formula:** Magnitude of the gradient is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \( G = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2} \).
- **Channels:** Separate calculations for red, green, and blue channels.

### Step 9: Cap Values at 255
```c
G_red = (G_red > 255) ? 255 : G_red;
G_green = (G_green > 255) ? 255 : G_green;
G_blue = (G_blue > 255) ? 255 : G_blue;
```
- Ensures that color values do not exceed the maximum allowable value (255).

### Step 10: Update the Image
```c
image[i][j].rgbtRed = G_red;
image[i][j].rgbtGreen = G_green;
image[i][j].rgbtBlue = G_blue;
```
- Assign the computed gradient magnitudes to the current pixel.

## Summary
The `edges` function processes an image pixel-by-pixel, applying the Sobel operator to calculate intensity gradients. The result is an image highlighting edges, useful for further image analysis or artistic effects.
